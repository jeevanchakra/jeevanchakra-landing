                        Jeevan Chakra is a life infrastructure system that creates financial continuity through a
                        self-sustaining 7-instrument investment cycle. Unlike traditional financial planning that
                        focuses only on returns, we prioritize protection first, then systematic wealth building that
                        generates passive income.

                        Mutual funds are just one investment vehicle. Jeevan Chakra is a complete financial ecosystem

                        G-Secs, POMIS, FDs), and automated cash flow distribution. It's designed to be self-sustaining
                        and generate monthly passive income.

                        All investments carry market risk. However, our 7-instrument diversification spreads risk across
                        different asset classes. We prioritize capital protection through government securities
                        (G-Secs), POMIS, and FDs alongside growth instruments. Your capital is secured through insurance
                        before any investments begin. Read our <a href="/legal/disclaimer.html"

                        Yes, your money is yours. However, the system is designed for long-term wealth creation (12-15
                        years to reach ₹1L/month passive income). Early withdrawal may interrupt the compounding cycle
                        and delay your financial goals. Different instruments have different liquidity: some are instant
                        (FDs), others may take a few days (REITs, InvITs).

                        You'll start seeing monthly returns from day one as instruments begin generating income.
                        However, reaching ₹1 Lakh/month passive income typically takes 12-15 years with consistent
                        ₹45K/month investment. Early returns are reinvested to accelerate compounding.
